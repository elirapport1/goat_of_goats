    Calculates a single 'Soccer Index Score' for each player by combining
    multiple soccer-specific stats:
      - Club and international performance (appearances, goals, assists, etc.)
      - Trophies & accolades
      - Discipline (red/yellow cards)
      - Doping tests and injuries
      - Advanced metrics (pass accuracy, key passes, etc.)
      - Earnings and Hall of Fame induction
    
    Adjust multipliers to reflect the importance of each metric in soccer.
    Higher weights are assigned to more prestigious achievements.
    Negative weights are used for detrimental stats like red cards or doping failures.
